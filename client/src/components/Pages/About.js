          <p>HYPED started with a vision of a sneaker head that wanted one place where you could
             read up on all things culture , music, art and fashion.
             HYPED aims to bridge the gap between these different things that we love not only to bring these differnt forms of self-expression 
             togetber but also to bring people from diffrent Art backgrounds together as i belive all the different genres are forms of Art
             i would just like to thank you for using this application i have built I hope that You will enjoy  and even learn new things about all these different forms of self-expression. Many thanks
